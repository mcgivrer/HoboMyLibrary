Installation of the framework

 sudo gem install rails
 sudo gem install hobo
 sudo apt-get install sqlite3
 sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
 sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby

Now we are going to create our first Hobo application

 hobo MyLibrary

focus in the just create app directory

 cd MyLibrary

And now create our first datamodel :  a book modelisation

 script/generate hobo_model_resource book title:string author:string year:integer resume:text note:integer

nos, we are going to create this model persistence into the default sqlite3  database

 script/generate hobo_migration 
(choose the 'm' option)

Ok, done.  now run the rails server (WebBrick):

 script/server

browser on http://localhost:3000/


Look at the title of the application :"My Library" !  Just because we call our project "MyLibrary" (without any space), Hobo kindly titled our welcome page with a beautiful "My Library" in a good old english. 

Identify yourself by creating the first user account which will act as administrator for this new application.

And now start playing with your books collection !

Yes I am impressed to discover how the Hobo dev team has been very careful with all details.
