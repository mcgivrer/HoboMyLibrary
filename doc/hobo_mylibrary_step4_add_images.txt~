MyLibrary - Step 4, Adding a cover picture
------------------------------------------

What about adding a picture of our book, in the detail view ?

Stuff Installation
------------------

First we will need some plugin and some new libs to perform image integration:
Thanks to xx with the following lines (Ubuntu powa !)


 sudo apt-get remove --purge librmagick-ruby-doc librmagick-ruby1.8
 sudo apt-get install libmagick9-dev ruby1.8-dev
 sudo gem install rmagick

and we want to install a plugin from github, so we will need the git command:

 sudo apt-get install git-core

Now, we are in front of 2 possibilities:

- using FlexImage, a rails plugin to manager and manipulate images
- paperclip+papeclip_with_hobo, a more common and well known rails plugin already integrated with hobo. This will be our choice for this tutorial.

Now, we can install the 2 small Rails plugin:

 cd [path_to]/MyLibrary/
 script/plugin install git://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip.git
 script/plugin install http://github.com/tablatom/paperclip_with_hobo


Adding a cover to our Book model
--------------------------------
Now we have all the needed software (libs, tools and rails plugin) we are able to enhance our library with some cover images.

before using this plugin, just add the following line to your MyLibrary/views/taglibs/application.dryml

 <include src="paperclip" plugin="paperclip_with_hobo"/>


Ok, done.

Now, edit the Book model file: app/model/book.rb, and add 'has_attached_file :cover' to the file, just before the previous added "belongs_to" link.


class Book < ActiveRecord::Base

  hobo_model # Don't put anything above this

  fields do
	...
  end
  
  has_attached_file :cover

  belongs_to :category
	...
end

As it's done, you can run the paperclip migration generator:

 script/generate paperclip Book cover

the needed fields to store image file information are now added to the table books in your database.
