I've just implement in my small demo test hobo website (a library management tool), and want to add some picture for book cover.
So I've install paperclip, and paperclip_with_hobo but running the webBrick server I get solme strange path for image embedded images:

My model :

 class Book < ActiveRecord::Base

  hobo_model # Don't put anything above this

  fields do
    title  :string
    author :string
    year   :integer
    resume :text
    note   :integer
    timestamps
  end
  
  has_attached_file :cover, :styles => { 
  		:full=>"600x600>", 
  		:medium => "300x300>", 
  		:thumb => "100x100>", 
  		:mini => "60x60>" },
  		:path => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/public/media/books/covers/:id/:style.:extension"

  belongs_to :category
  ...
 End



And in the generated page, with the source inspector, I can read :

  <a class="book-link" href="/books/2-the-da-vinci-code">
    <img src="/system/covers/2/thumb/DaVinciCode.jpg?1266775825" />
  </a> 


And as You can see, the path is not really the one I have parametered !

Any idea ?
