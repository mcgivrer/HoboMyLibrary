 - *note* a note grading the book (1 to 10)
 - *timestamps* (created_at, updated_at)
 - *cover* (image) a picture (if exists) of the cover of the book

A book can be linked to a category.

Each category (models/category.rb) is represented by the following attributes :
 - *name*     name of the category
 - *sorder*   sort order of the category
 - *timestamps* (created_at, updated_at)
